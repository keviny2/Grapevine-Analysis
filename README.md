# Grapevine-Analysis
Agro-thermal heat-treatment technology in grapevines has been shown to increase fruit set and yield, decrease the use of agro-chemicals used to fight pests such as botrytis, enhance wine quality, and improve profits. However, this technology has not been tested in the Okanagan Valley or Canada.  Over a period of two years, heat treatment will be applied to two vineyards in the Okanagan valleyâ€”a Merlot and one with the presence of botrytis, a fungus that commonly affects wine grapes. Heat will be applied six times during the growing season, with application ten days apart from each other. Heat treatment is applied by driving a tractor through the vineyard rows that blows extreme heat into the canopy. For the vineyard with presence of botrytis, botryticide was also applied once in July but only in grapevines that were not subjected to heat treatment.  The objective of the experiments is to determine the impact that heat treatment has on multiple measurements related with grape quality in the Merlot vineyard, and in the prevention of botrytis in the other vineyard. The vineyards were split into physical blocks of similar topographical characteristics, and all treatments were randomly applied within each block. Data have already been collected from the first year of heat application. Specifically, 4 to 5 grapevines (out of around 70) were randomly selected from each row in both vineyards and measured.
